		<h1>Picnic Spot</h1>
			<p>
			Here you can get a spot outside the city. Instead of going far away travelling for two-three days and getting a place where you can enjoy the nature, see the open sky full of stars, surrounded with the trees, you can get such type of spots near you in the villages around you. You can book and enjoy there with your family.
			</p>

	<div class="topics-description">
		<h1>Book a Piece of Land!</h1>
			<p>
				Book / adopt a piece of land whereevr you want, and of what amount you want and grow whatever you want to grow in that area. And grow the way you want to grow in that area. It's like buying a small piece of land for the time you want it to be with you by just paying the rent for that area to the person the land belongs to and then grow the vegetables or fruits for you home without using the fertilizers.
